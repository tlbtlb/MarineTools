about=Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) is an application originally developed in 2005 at Oregon State University under a cooperative agreement with the NOAA Coastal Services Center's (CSC) GIS Integration and Development program (Wright et al., 2005). The application provides a set of geoprocessing tools to analyze benthic terrain for the purposes of classifying surficial seafloor characteristics that may be used in studies of benthic habitat, geomorphology, prediction of benthic fish species distribution, marine protected area design, and more. From an input grid of multibeam bathymetry the user may create additional grids of slope, bathymetric position index or BPI (a variation on the topographic position index approach of Guisan et al. 1999 and Weiss, 2001), and seafloor rugosity (after Jenness, 2003 and Iampietro and Kvitek, 2002).
